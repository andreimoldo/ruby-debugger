# debugger-ruby package

Ruby debugger for Atom. Inspired by [atom-ruby-debugger](https://github.com/johanlunds/atom-ruby-debugger). The main reasoning behind this project is my lack of CoffeeScript skills.

# Todo

- Call stack
- Visual indicator on lines with breakpoints
- Navigate to line when clicking breakpoints
